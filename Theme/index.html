									<h3>Embracing My Inner Nerd - Getting Into Code</h3>
									<img src="images/blogpic.jpg" alt="">

									<h3> How It All Started </h3>
									<p> I have wanted to learn how to code since my senior year of college but never had the courage. After I learned that going to law school wasn’t for me, I knew I wanted to be involved in the tech scene in my hometown, NYC. I had I have always been a nerd and problem solver at heart. With my history of being a chess champ, a band geek, fencer, American History buff, musical theatre trivia extraordinaire, and Lord of the Rings enthusiast, it was about time. </p>

									<p> Since I didn’t have the technical skills to land a job as an engineer, I decided to get into digital marketing and ended up at an amazing agency where I specialized in paid search. The company and the people were everything you could dream off, great friendships, awesome work-life balance, great career trajectory, amazing off site trips, etc… Even with all those perks and a bright future, something was missing. </p>

									<p> The “something” missing was my dream of becoming a coder, especially a front end developer. I knew fate stepped in when I won a free one-day intro class to HTML and CSS3 through a random raffle. After the class, I was in love. I signed up for the bootcamp and my new adventure began! </p>

									<h3> Taking The Plunge </h3>

									<p> Stepping in my first day of class, I was greeted with friendly faces and delicious bagels. The class consisted of seven people, six boys and me! Girl power! I was so excited to start learning and creating things. As the class progressed, it required more and more of my time, which meant, after a full day of work, I would go home and code for 2 to 3 hours. Every night, I would look forward to my coding sessions and would cringe when I missed working out because I got carried away creating projects. </p>
									
									<p> Three months into the boot camp, I decided that it was time for me to take a leave at work in order to pursue coding full time. It was a scary thing to decide, but I knew it was the right thing to do. </p>
									
									<h3> Not Having A Computer Science Degree </h3>

									<p> I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from a wonderful college and if I could go back, I would probably declare my Computer Science as my major right away. Unfortunately, I am a couple years out of graduation and can’t turn back time. </p>
									
									<p> Thankfully, we live in an age of the internet where everything you want to learn in out here. If you truly want to know something all you have to do is dedicate time and really love what you’re doing. </p>
									
									
									<h3> Things I Have Learned On The Way </h3>
									
									<p> No matter how much and how long you have coded, you will never know everything. </p>
									
									<p> This is a comforting thought. I realized this when I went to a AngularJS workshop and was taught by a man who had been a programmer for over 20 years and had been doing AngularJS for our of them. At one point in the session he got stuck on a problem and the whole class, about 30 senior programmers, were trying to figure it out with him. What did this say to me? Don’t be too hard on yourself when you don’t know something. </p>
									
									
									<h3> What To Do Now? </h3>
									
									<p> Keep learning JavaScript, solidify my knowledge in HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootcamp,  and become the best front end developer I can be. It isn't all unicorns and rainbows in the life of an up and coming developer, but it's pretty darn close. </p>
									
									<p> As I look for a company to work for, I'm looking for a place that makes the world a better place and is filled with kick ass engineers  who remember what it felt like coming “from the bottom” and a heart filled with enthusiasm and passion to make a difference with the computer magic we call coding. </p>
			
									<p> The time is now.  Come join me on my journey :). </p>

									<h3> Blog # 2 - City Love - New York City</h3>
									<p> NYC is a wonderful city. Like most cities, there are good things and there are not so good things: the people work hard, the rent is high, the food is wonderful, the winters are cold, the transportation is pretty good, the mice are friendly, etc… Either way, thousands of people flock to it or dream to live here. </p>

									<p> Growing up in NYC, you get exposed to a lot of things, culturally, socially, etc... For the post, I’ll gave you a few of my favorite things to do in NYC. </p>
									
									<p> If you ever make a trip to the East Coast, here are some activities that you may enjoy: </p>

									<h3> The Arts </h3>

									<p> Take a trip down to the Great White Way and see Hamilton. This musical masterpiece will blow you away with it’s combination of Hip Hop and musical theatre. If you can’t score a ticket, enter the lottery and test your luck! </p>
									
									<h3>Museums </h3>
									
									<p> One of my favorite museums in the city is The Cloisters! Take a trip to this castle and enjoy the view of the Hudson River, the George Washington Bridge, and Medieval and Renaissance Art. </p>
									
									
									<h3>Bars </h3>
									
									<p> I absolutely love musical theatre and karaoke. One of my favorite bars in NYC is called “Marie’s Crisis”. This cash only bar is located underground and you can find a piano in the middle of the room. The bar patrons request songs and the whole bar signs along all night! It’s a blast! </p>
									
									<h3>Food </h3>
									
									<p> I absolutely love food. If I were to pick one place to take friends who were from out of town, I would take them to Sylvia’s Harlem Restaurant, founded by Sylvia Woods, the Queen of Soulfood, you will not be disappointed! :) </p>
									
									<h3>Sports </h3>
									<p> New York City is pretty lucky to have so many sports teams! Some good, some bad, there is something for everyone! You can always score baseball, football, basketball, hockey or soccer tickets  on Stubhub! </p>

									<p> There are a ton of other gems! If you need more ideas, send me an email! </p>

									 <h4> Here are a couple of things I do when I feel stuck! </h4>
									 <ul>

										<li> Walk to the furthest water cooler in the office and say hi to a couple of people on the way back to my desk </li>
										<li> Take a silly Buzzfeed quiz </li>
										<li> Close my eyes and listen to a song that’s at least 3 minutes long </li>
